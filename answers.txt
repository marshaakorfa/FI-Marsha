THEORY
Git is a version control system used to manage and track changes in computer files mainly codes for projects
 
WHY GIT IS IMPORTANT
1. Git records every change made to files in your project
2.Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously without causing conflicts
3.When changes from different branches are ready. Git can merge them together
4.Branches allow you to create separate copies of your project to work on without affecting the main project

Follow these steps
Sign up (if you do not have an account on git) / Log into your GitHub
Click on the "+" ICON and click on "NEW REPOSITORY"
A new page will appear. Type in your name and add description if necessary
Choose either public or private
Now move to your terminal
Navigate to your desktop using "cd desktop"
Create a new directory with a name eg mkdir githubprojects
Then you create a file like this eg touch file.txt
Now we will initiate git
Initialise git with this "git init"
Add the file we created to git with this eg git add file.txt
Commit the changes with git commit -m "commit message" eg git commit -m "first git project"
Link your  file to your GitHub repository like this type (git remote add origin https:/github.com/username/repo-nname.git) on your git
Now push your file to GitHub like this git push -u origin main
Check your GitHub to confirm if the file has been pushed
